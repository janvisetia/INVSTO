This project analyzes historical stock price data for eight major US technology companies (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, META, NVDA, NFLX) from January 2019 to December 2024. The primary objective is to develop and compare two distinct forecasting models for NVIDIA (NVDA) stock prices:

• ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A classical statistical time-series model

• Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR): A machine learning ensemble approach

The comparison evaluates both models across multiple dimensions: accuracy (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), reliability (train/test performance stability), and practical applicability for trading strategies.
